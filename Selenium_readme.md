This is to show my progress with Selenium related projects.

Steps to follow for creating repositories practice:
Do following under Development dir:
* Create dir
* Create a readme file, etx .md
* git init
* git add .
* git commit -m "add message"
* git remote add origin [ssh .git link]
* git remote -v --- to check origin
* git push origin master --- to push changes
